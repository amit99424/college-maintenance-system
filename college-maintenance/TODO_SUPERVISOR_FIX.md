# Supervisor Dashboard Fix Implementation Plan

## Current Issues Identified:
1. Supervisors tab not showing real complaints from Firebase
2. Category-specific views not displaying correct complaints
3. Filters not applying properly to fetched data
4. No "No complaints available" message when no data exists

## Steps to Fix:

### 1. Fix Supervisor Complaints Filtering
- [ ] Ensure `supervisorComplaints` correctly filters complaints assigned to the logged-in supervisor
- [ ] Fix the `getSupervisorComplaintsByCategory` function to properly filter by category

### 2. Improve Category View Logic
- [ ] Ensure category cards show correct complaint counts for each category
- [ ] Fix the filtering logic when a specific category is selected

### 3. Apply Filters Correctly
- [ ] Ensure supervisor name filter works on the fetched data
- [ ] Ensure status filter applies correctly to supervisor complaints
- [ ] Make sure date filters work with real-time data

### 4. Add "No complaints available" Messages
- [ ] Add appropriate messages when no complaints exist for supervisors
- [ ] Add messages when no complaints exist for specific categories

### 5. Maintain Design Consistency
- [ ] Ensure the updated views match the existing dashboard design
- [ ] Keep the same styling and layout patterns

## Files to Modify:

## Testing:
